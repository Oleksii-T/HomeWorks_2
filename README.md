# HomeWorkds_1

C++ language. 28/07/2017 - 02/05/2017

This repository contains 5 independent home works I did on Programming and Algorithms course of my 1-semester study at Czech Technical University in Prague.

All of these were made on Ubuntu using 'gcc' (version 4.8.4) compiler. That was the very first programming experience I had.

Task description, sample runs, and submission results are included in the end of each code in the end as a comment.
